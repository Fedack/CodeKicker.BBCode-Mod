CodeKicker.BBCode-Mod
=====================

Modifications to CodeKicker.BBCode at http://bbcode.codeplex.com/

##First things first
CodeKicker.BBCode is a project hosted on [CodePlex](http://bbcode.codeplex.com/) that offers BBCode parsing and rendering functionality. I've got no involvement in that project at all, but TFS projects on CodePlex are pretty horrific to do anything with so I'm publishing a couple of fixes I made for a recent project on GitHub.

##What fixes?
There're a bunch of BBCode parsers out there for .NET but none of them seem to be perfect. The CodeKicker implementation's better than most, though still had a few issues I needed to overcome.

##Licence
The original CodeKicker.BBCode implementation is licensed under the MIT Licence. My modifications to the original implementation are released under the same terms.
